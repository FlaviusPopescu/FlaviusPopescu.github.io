The latter is derived from data models, or entities, provided by the data layer. Sometimes, additional business logic is needed in order to determine what state the system should be in.\nWhat is the optional domain layer then, and what purpose does it serve in a layered app architecture?\n\nViewModel vs UseCase\nA ViewModel provides access to the business logic, and produces a state stream consumed by UI logic (where further transformations occur alongside platform-specific implementation details such as the Android Context and Resources). The state can change because of upstream events, like a network response updating the application's data, or the user performing an action that would create or modify that data in some meaningful way as modeled by the product requirements.\nAlthough typically each ViewModel is associated with a single app screen, sometimes the ViewModel class can still grow and become harder to manage and test. The business logic can then be extracted in UseCase classes, and that can be especially helpful in two situations:\n\nYou want to re-use a piece of simple logic.\nFor example, if multiple ViewModels perform the same type of user input validation, or access a common resource such as a user preference, those ViewModels can inject the common use case as a dependency.\nYou want to extract complex logic out of the ViewModel.\nFor example, if a user flow requires a complex orchestration of multiple data components to process a new UI event or input, this logic can be better managed and tested in isolation if it is in its own UseCase class.\n\nUseCase vs Repository\nSometimes, additional data processing on the app side is necessary, especially when the app's \"backend\" (e.g., a cloud service, a different embedded device, etc.) does not or should not implement a certain requirement. This moves the responsibility to one of the app's components.\nIf this happens, consider whether that data processing logic belongs in a data layer component first, such as a repository or one of its data source dependencies.\nUse cases focus less on data transformations and more on what the app should do in a given system state. Ideally, their logic operates on domain entity objects which allow the decoupling of app logic from any particular backend implementation.\nNaming\nUse the scheme verb + noun (what) + UseCase, e.g. FormatInputUseCase , or GetPostHistoryWithAuthorsUseCase.\nA Mars Example\nLet's imagine a playful scenario in which a scientist, located inside a Martian base, uses an Android device to command and control a fleet of autonomous rovers. These can be deployed anywhere on the planet's surface to perform specific analyses on various environmental samples.\nSuppose the operator selected a region, and would like to plan a mission to determine the feasibility of a base expansion in that area.\nA complex use case such as this one may require combining different elements in order to perform the task:\n\nThe use case may depend on data layer components as seen above – one or more repositories. To make it easier to test, interfaces can be used:\n\nThe main class implementation leverages a planetary network service to produce a state list of online rovers with the given capability.\nIn the test, the interface allows injecting a fake. For example, FakeRoverRepository returns a list of rovers compatible with the base expansion mission, but some of them may be running out of battery which would influence the probability of mission success. Fakes allow capturing a variety of stateful behaviors, and decouple the use case code, e.g. from specific network or database implementations.\nUse Case recommendations\n\ndo name your use case as a verb or function-like name\ndo expose a single public member, e.g. allows callers to use the invoke operator function planBaseExpansionUseCase(coordinates)\ndo make your executor function main-safe (the use case is responsible for managing its concurrency policy by switching to the appropriate thread to do the work)\ndon't add multiple responsibilities to the same use-case, instead create separate use cases (e.g. ExecuteMissionUseCase)\ndo depend on interfaces in the use case constructor, instead of concrete implementations\ndo return primitive types or domain/data entities from the use case\ndon't make the use case dependent on any platform-specific classes (e.g. don't import anything android.*)\ndo create a use case for simple business logic that is re-used a lot, or for complex logic making viewModels harder to maintain\nconsider whether your business logic could more easily be kept in the data layer instead of creating a use case, unless you have a specific need to route everything through the domain layer, perhaps using a framework\n\nUltimately, use the pattern that most easily helps you implement your application's product requirements and produce value to customers. By separating component responsibilities and promoting testability, issues are easier to isolate and analyze, while you can maintain a high-quality, robust codebase, which scales quickly with the influx of new product requirements.\n","id":"https://flavius.dev/blog/architecture-use-cases/","title":"Architecture Note: Use Cases in Android"}},"docInfo":{"https://flavius.dev/":{"body":5,"title":3},"https://flavius.dev/about/":{"body":6,"title":0},"https://flavius.dev/blog/":{"body":1,"title":0},"https://flavius.dev/blog/architecture-use-cases/":{"body":531,"title":5}},"length":4},"lang":"English"}
